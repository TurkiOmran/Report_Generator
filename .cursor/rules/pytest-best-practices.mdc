- Use fixtures for setup and teardown of test environments
- Write clear and descriptive test names
- Group related tests in classes or modules
- Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- Test with real CSV data samples, not mocked data
