- Use environment-based API key management (never hardcode keys)
- Implement error handling and retry logic for API calls
- Validate responses before using them
- Optimize token usage by providing only necessary context
- Handle timeouts gracefully
- Never use LLM for deterministic calculations - only for narrative analysis
- Pass pre-computed metrics to LLM, never ask it to calculate metrics
