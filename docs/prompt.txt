You are analyzing a cryptocurrency miner power profile test. The test measures how the miner responds when its power target changes.

Test Information:
- Test: {test_id}
- Miner: {miner_number}

Raw Test Data (CSV):
{csv_content}

Column Definitions:
- miner.seconds: Time in seconds (negative = before action, positive = after action, 0 = transition moment)
- miner.mode.power: Target power setting commanded to the miner (in watts)
- miner.summary.wattage: Actual power consumption measured (in watts)
- miner.temp.hash_board_max: Hash board temperature (°C)
- miner.psu.temp_max: PSU temperature (°C)
- miner.outage: Whether miner is offline

Task:
Write a brief narrative describing what happened during this test. Focus on the power profile behavior:
- How stable was power before the transition?
- What happened at the transition (t=0)?
- How did power respond after the transition?
- Were there any anomalies, drops, spikes, or instabilities?

Be concise and observational. Describe what you see in the data timeline. Avoid calculations or technical jargon - just tell the story of what the miner did.
